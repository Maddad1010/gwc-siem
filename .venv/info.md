# üõ°Ô∏è GWC-SIEM: Mini SIEM for Home Labs & Hacktoberfest

GWC-SIEM is a lightweight Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool designed for home labs, learning, and Hacktoberfest contributions. It parses common logs, detects simple security events like SSH brute-force attacks and HTTP 5xx bursts, stores alerts in SQLite, and exposes them via **FastAPI API**, CLI, and a lightweight dashboard.
